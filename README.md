## Single Node Blockchain (Work in Progress)

Blockchain built on a Single Node with Python 3.

An attempt to simulate the Bitcoin Blockchain as much as I can.

More to come in the README. If you're curious run it :)

`python blockchain.py`

### Requirements:

`python 3`

### Overview:

"Blockchain" is on a simulated "Internet".

"Nodes" are "connected" on the "Internet".

The Internet bootstraps all connections and builds a genesis block.

"Nodes" are running "Programs" like "Miners".

_Catch_ : One Node behaves as Switch that "broadcasts" packets to all nodes on the internet. Yes this blockchain has a SPOF, deal with it ðŸ˜Ž
